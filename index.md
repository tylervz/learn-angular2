Angular 2 is the next version of Google's massively popular MV* framework for building complex
applications in the browser (and beyond).

Angular 2 comes with almost everything you need to build a complicated frontend web or mobile apps, from powerful templates to fast rendering, data management, HTTP services, form handling, and so much more.

This simple tutorial site was built by the [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) team with the goal of getting developers using Angular 2 features as well as TypeScript/ES2015 quickly through simple, straight-to-the-point tutorials. We felt like the Angular 2 documentation available on the web was too wordy and complicated for beginners and we wanted to change that.

We hope you enjoy this simple introduction to Angular 2 and TypeScript, and please let us know if anything seems wrong or outdated by [filing an issue](https://github.com/driftyco/learn-angular2) on the repo.
